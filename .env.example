# Plasmic Version Control

# Controls which version of Plasmic content to load
#
# Options:
#   - "latest" (default): Always fetch the newest published version
#   - "1.0.0": Lock to a specific version number
#   - Leave unset: Defaults to "latest"
#
# Usage:
#   Development: Leave unset or use "latest" for immediate updates
#   Staging: Set to test new versions before production
#   Production: Pin to a stable version for predictable content
#
# Example:
#   PUBLIC_PLASMIC_VERSION=latest
#
# Rollback Instructions:

# To roll back to a previous version:
#   1. Find the version number in Plasmic Studio (Project Settings > Versions)
#   2. Set PUBLIC_PLASMIC_VERSION to that version (e.g., PUBLIC_PLASMIC_VERSION=1.0.0)
#   3. Restart your development server or redeploy to production
#   4. Your site will now display content from that version
